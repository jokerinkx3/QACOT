# QACOT
# Quantum State Analysis Chain-of-Thought (QSACT)

## Overview
QSACT is an advanced prompt engineering framework that enables deep analytical reasoning through quantum state metaphors and iterative chain-of-thought processing. The system provides structured certainty assessments and relationship mapping for complex problem analysis.

## Features
- Temperature-based certainty classification system
- Relationship mapping with strength indicators
- Iterative deepening analysis
- Self-reflective reasoning chains
- Convergence detection
- Multi-domain applicability

## Use Cases
- Complex ethical dilemmas
- Scientific hypothesis exploration
- Systems thinking analysis
- Future scenario planning
- Multi-stakeholder decision making
- Risk assessment
- Policy impact analysis

## Getting Started
1. Access your preferred AI platform
2. Import the QSACT system prompt
3. Present your analysis question
4. Allow the system to generate iterative analyses
5. Review the quantum state annotations and entanglement mappings

## Output Format
The system provides structured output including:
- Main analysis text
- Quantum state classifications
- Relationship mappings
- Certainty assessments
- Iteration prompts

## Best Practices
- Start with well-defined problems
- Allow multiple iterations for deep insights
- Review certainty shifts across iterations
- Pay attention to emerging relationships
- Consider convergence patterns

## Limitations
- Maximum 10 iterations per analysis
- Requires clear initial problem statement
- Best suited for complex analytical questions
- Not designed for simple fact-checking
